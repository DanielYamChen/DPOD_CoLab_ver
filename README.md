# [Dense Pose Object Detector (Google CoLab version)]

This a Google CoLab version code modified from [yashs97's repo](https://github.com/yashs97/DPOD). It is a recreation of the methodology for 6D pose estimation by  DPOD: 6D Pose Object Detector and Refiner, written by Sergey Zakharov, Ivan Shugurov, Slobodan Ilic [[1]](#references).
